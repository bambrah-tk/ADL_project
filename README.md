## Topic: Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
**Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** is a classic problem in computer vision where the goal is to recognize and interpret text from images or scanned documents. Traditional OCR methods often involve complex pre-processing techniques, feature engineereing and classical machine learning algortihms such as SVM. In this project, the goald would be to leverage deep learning techniques to beat the performance of traditional OCR methods. So the type of this project would be **"Beat the classics"**.  <br>
The datasets that I would be using are the famous MNIST (handwritten digits) and EMNIST (handwrittten letters). <br>
The idea would be to develop a robust OCR system capable of revognizing both handwritten digits and handwritten letters accurately. Therefore I would be using CNNs and LSTM.

## Work-breakdown structure:
