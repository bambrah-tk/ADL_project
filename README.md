## Topic: Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
**Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** is a classic problem in computer vision where the goal is to recognize and interpret text from images or scanned documents. Traditional OCR methods often involve complex pre-processing techniques, feature engineereing and classical machine learning algortihms such as SVM. <br>
In this project, the goald would be to leverage deep learning techniques to beat the performance of traditional OCR methods. So the type of this project would be **"Beat the classics"**.  <br>
The datasets that I would be using are the famous MNIST (handwritten digits) and EMNIST (handwrittten letters). <br>
The idea would be to develop a robust OCR system capable of revognizing both handwritten digits and handwritten letters accurately. Therefore I would be using CNNs and LSTM.

## Work-breakdown structure:
- Data Preprocessing: 5 days
- Model Design and Architecture Selection: 5 days
- Training and Fine-Tuning:  10 days
- Evaluation and Comparison: 2 days
- Improvement Iterations: 5 days
- Building Application : 10 days
- Preparing Presentation: 2 days 
- Documentation and Writing Final Report: 3 days

(days doesn't mean full days, it means spending some hours at a day)

## Ideas for me
- experiment with CNN and RNN or maybe also transformer based models for sequence recogntiton
- use appropriate loss functions CTC
- evaluation- depends on the paper
- data augmentation with rotations, scaling and noise  <br>
.... to be continued
